    <div class="about-content">

      <p>
        I am a web developer focused on building clean, responsive, and
        user-friendly web interfaces. I enjoy transforming ideas into
        simple and effective digital experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary skills include HTML and CSS with a strong
        understanding of layout design, responsiveness, and modern UI and python. I believe good design should be both visually clear
        and easy to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am continuously improving my skills by building real projects
        and learning industry-relevant tools. My goal is to grow into a
        well-rounded developer who contributes meaningfully to real-world
        products.
